# Fan Led Display

#### A project at School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade, Serbia

#### Video demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YXIKNycpRV0)

#### Overview:

The rotating system consists of an aluminum disk attached to a hand drill and electronics on the disk. There is a plastic stick attached to the stationary part of the drill which passes through a led & photo-transistor sensor placed on the bottom side of the disk to sync rotation speed and drawing frequency. The whole system is controlled over WiFi using a WiFi module which is built into ESP8266 on the NodeMCU board.

Remote controller pc app was written in C++ using SDL2 and boost. NodeMCU code was written in C++ using Arduino IDE.
